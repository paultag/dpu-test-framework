Debian Package Utility Test Framework
=====================================

Debian has various packaging tools including package checkers and
build helpers (such as Lintian and debhelper).  But there are very few
utilities to assist with tests of these utilties - the end result is
that many tools has limited testing.

This framework is intended to end this unfortunate tendency by greatly
reducing the boilerplate code and package fragments needed to build
and "post process" a package.  This is basically a fork of the Lintian
test suite with a goal to make it useful for other programs.
