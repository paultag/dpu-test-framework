 - test/ contain a set of directories, which contain test payloads.
 - templates/ contain the basics that the test source is generated from
 - ???/ will contain the method in which packages are built (like d/rules,
        to allow building of upstream source tarballs, etc)
   XXX: not implemented.

global stuff
============

context.json is the base context file. As much as can be kept here should be.
the other json files (in order: template, test) will override parts of this
file.

test
====

A test consists of a test.json file, which overloads bits from the template's
context.json, an overlay directory, which holds both upstream and debian files.
This will klobber template files, if need be.

A test defines it's "class" -- which is one of the d/rules style scripts.
Simple stuff, like:

  source-native
  source-upstream
  binary-native
  binary-upstream

(so we don't have to do full binary builds for source checks, like versions,
 building upstream tarballs, etc)

templates
=========

The templates consist of a global context.json, which gets overriden on a
per-test basis, and a template direcotry. .tpl files gets rendered out without
the extention.
